##### Disk Operating System - DOS
- First computers didn't have modern storage devices. Old storage methods like punch cards, magnetic tapes, and even **audio cassettes** were used in those days.
- In relation to the above, floppy disks and hard disk storage require software to read from, write to, and manage the data they store.
- A Disk Operating System (DOS) is an **operating system** that the computer uses to enable these data storage devices to read and write files. DOS provides a file system **which** organizes the files in a specific way on the disk.

##### MS-DOS
- Microsoft acquired 86-DOS and developed MS-DOS. MS-DOS used a CLI (Command Line Interface) for users to create programs, manipulate data files, and view the command output. 
- **Example of MS-DOS commands and output:**

~~~MS-DOS
Starting MS-DOS...
HIMEM is testing extended memory... done.
C:∖> **C:∖DOS∖SMARTDRV.EXE /X**
C:∖> **dir**
Volume in drive C is MS-DOS_6

- With MS-DOS, the computer knows exactly how to **access** the disk drive and load the OS files directly from the disk as part of the boot process. Once it is loaded, MS-DOS can easily access the disk because the drivers are **built** into the OS.
- Early versions of Windows came with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that ran **on top of** MS-DOS. These versions still used DOS to control the hardware and the computer.

##### Windows NT
- Windows NT (Windows New **Technology**) is not considered a DOS-based system. The operating system itself is in direct control of the computer and its hardware. 
- NT is an OS with support for multitasking and multiple user processes. This is much different than the **single-tasking**, single-user MS-DOS.
